The python version was the simplest out of them all (mostly because python is a very high level language).
It works identical to the java version.
Like the java version, the python version might accept floating point values as well as integers.
I wouldn't think it'd work anyways because nothing is cast to a float during computation/calculation, so the value would become an int anyways.
