The java version isn't compatible with floating point values as input.
It may be, I never tested it, but i highly doubt it since the values are parsed as an integer first.
The java version and the python version are identical in functionality because they both have implementations of a map/dictionary.
Maps and dictionaries made it significantly easier.
